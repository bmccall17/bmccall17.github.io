# Task: Darketype Phase 2 (Signature Visuals)

## Active: Cross-site Leakage
- [x] **Mess Heatmap Timeline**:
    - [x] Backend: `scripts/build_weblog.js` generates `heatmap.json`.
    - [x] Frontend: `darketype/weblog/index.html` visualizes it.
- [x] **Progressive Legibility**:
    - [x] `.cipher` aesthetic implemented in `darketype/css/style.css`.
    - [x] JS logic for binary encryption/decryption on hover in `darketype/weblog/index.html`.

## Planned: Cross-site Leakage
- [ ] **Cross-site Leakage**: subtle links between portfolio and darketype.
    - [ ] Add more "glitch" links in Portfolio pointing to specific Darketype entries?
    - [ ] Create a "wormhole" effect?

## Completed Phase 2 Items
- [x] **Singularity Integration**:
    - [x] Prototype (`test_binary_toggle.html`)
    - [x] Refactor to `scripts/singularity.js` & `css/singularity.css`
    - [x] Integrate into `index.html`
    - [x] Basic controls.

## Backlog / Polish
- [ ] Mobile optimization & performance tuning
- [ ] Refine Heatmap visuals (make it more "glitchy")
