# the problem
we needed a place to break things without breaking the "professional" us.

# the learning
binary code (0 and 1) is a perfect metaphor for "planning vs acting". phase 0 is the pause. phase 1 is the glitch.
also, `mkdir` is faster than `list_dir` when you know the folder doesn't exist yet.

# the mess
- imported workflows from other projects, then immediately broke them (re-wrote them in lowercase).
- established a "chaos" rule set that demands we ignore grammar police.
- tried to list a directory before creating it, causing a nice red error in the logs. perfect.

# glimmers (code snippets)
```yaml
# /selfhealing
purpose: change *how* we build, without derailing *what* we build.
```
