we finally cracked the physics of the leak. static masking was too clean. too digital.

we needed gravity.

the new engine doesn't just erase the noise; it consumes it. the chaos pixels don't just vanish. they **accelerate, shrink, and disappear into the singularity**.

it feels less like cleaning a window and more like wielding a black hole. the cursor becomes an event horizon. information is not deleted; it is spaghettified into the void, revealing the polished reality underneath.

entropy is adjustable. from 0.0017 to 0.17. precision matters.

this is the signature visual. the polished self is always there, underneath, but you have to actively clear the chaos to find it.

soon, this will be the front door.
