we pushed the first major visual signature today. v0.2.0.

the static background is gone. in its place is a field of tiled entropy—a green matrix of noise that hides the signal.

to see the work, you have to engage with the chaos. the cursor is no longer just a pointer; it is a gravity well. pixels accelerate towards it, shrink, and vanish into the singularity. you clear your own path.

we dealt with the constraints:
- **mobile**: touch physics and fat-finger controls.
- **legibility**: frosted glass panels floating in the void.
- **alignment**: smart cropping to keep the signal (the face) in view even when the aspect ratio fights it.

this is the first step of phase 2. the interface is alive.
