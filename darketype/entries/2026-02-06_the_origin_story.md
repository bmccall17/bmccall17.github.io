# the problem
waking up with alot on my mind... mainly my portfolio and developing the accompanying site that is a bit of the darketype site where im practicing the "art of mess making" and logging my learnings. there is where i keep and continuously build my "failure" resume.

i wanting to make it primarily html, nerdy, monochrome in design. and wanting to build it with a coding tool to help me push the limits of what i can do with html... using stuff like php.

# the learning
**two public selves that tell the truth together.**
1. the "portfolio" is the curated artifact: legible, calm, narrow, trustworthy.
2. the "darketype" is the living lab: messy, glitchy, revealing, "failure resume".

the magic trick is the leak: binary code and "glitches" must bleed from one to the other.

# the mess
i even thought that my front facing portfolio site (brettamccall.com) would be pretty and narrow in focus with small bits of binary code "leaking" onto the page subtly (which is currently the case) while this darketype: art of messmaking, and failurefocused site would be primarily binary code that then (with user interaction) becomes more human readable yet chaotic magical and the more fully exposed underbelly of me.

i want a weblog on the darketype side...probably called "thee art uv messsmaking" glitchy and revealing. each entry is a mess -yet organized log of what im learning today and today and today.

# the product idea, distilled
“i’m not hiding the sausage-making. i’m making it the proof.”
```

# distillation
start with a "minimum lovable loop":
1. create a "mess entry" in 5–12 minutes.
2. publish fast.
3. search later.
