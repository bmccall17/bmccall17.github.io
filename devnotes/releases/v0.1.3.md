# release v0.1.3: the leak spreads

**date**: feb 07, 2026
**phase**: 2 (complete)
**focus**: signature visuals & cross-site leakage

## 1. the singularity stabilizes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Removed scroll blocking (`preventDefault` removed) and implemented resize debounce for smoother experience on touch devices.
- **Performance**: Canvas logic optimized for resize events.

## 2. the mess becomes visible (heatmap)
- **Visuals**: Implemented activity heatmap in `darketype/weblog`.
- **Glitch Aesthetic**: Added random flicker animations and interactive "growth" on hover to heatmap bars.
- **Data**: Driven by real file timestamps via `scripts/build_weblog.js`.

## 3. cross-site leakage protocol (cslp)
- **Concept**: A subtle, ephemeral connection between the polished portfolio (`brettamccall.com`) and the darketype playground.
- **Infection**: moving the mouse around the screen increases your "infection level" stored in `localStorage`.
- **Symptom**: The portfolio site now manifests glitches (binary text mutation -> `d a r k e t y p e`) and eventually accumulates "Darketype Pixels" on the screen edges.
- **Interaction**:
    - **Cursor Corruption**: Approaching the infected edges causes the cursor to emit green glitch particles.
    - **Pixel Jitter**: Edge pixels react violently when the mouse draws near.
- **Architecture**: Shared `localStorage` strategy due to same-origin hosting (GitHub Pages).

## next steps
- Deploy both repositories to activate the CSLP live.
- Begin **Phase 3**: Deep Metrics (PostHog) & Content Expansion.
