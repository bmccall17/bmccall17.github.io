# v0.1.2 - singularity

**released:** feb 06, 2026

## summary
phase 2 begins. the "Singularity" visual effect has replaced the static background, introducing a new era of interactive chaos and physics-driven aesthetics.

---

## changes
- **singularity engine**: a physics-based particle system that turns the cursor into a black hole.
- **chaos layer**: a tiled, randomized "matrix" of green pixels that covers the screen.
- **clean layer**: the polished portfolio content is revealed only by actively engaging with the chaos.
- **precision control**: an ultra-fine entropy slider (0.0017 - 0.17) tucked discreetly into the UI.
- **readability**: frosted glass backgrounds added to content panels to maintain legibility over the dynamic background.
- **mobile support**: full touch physics and 5x larger touch targets for mobile devices.
- **scroll lock**: the main page now captures scroll/touch events for the particle effect (intentional constraint).

## files changed

### new files
- `scripts/singularity.js` - the physics core.
- `css/singularity.css` - minimalist UI styling.
- `scripts/test_binary_toggle.html` - the prototype bench (retained for future tests).
- `darketype/entries/2026-02-06_singularity.md` - manifesto entry.

### modified files
- `index.html` - integrated the canvas, script, and controls.
- `css/main.css` - added transparency and backdrop filters for main content.

## verification
- [x] checked `index.html` (renders correctly with background)
- [x] checked `darketype/index.html` (remains independent)
