# v0.1.1 - the loop engaged

**released:** february 06, 2026

## summary
phase 1 complete. we have established the "loop": a system for publishing messes fast, reading them via a universal reader, and visualizing activity via a github-style contribution graph. the main portfolio `index.html` has been overhauled to match the new "github profile" aesthetic.

---

## changes
- **portfolio overhaul**: `index.html` now mimics a robust github profile (sidebar, contribution graph, pinned projects).
- **css extraction**: styles moved to `css/main.css` for cleaner architecture.
- **weblog engine**: 
  - `entry.html`: a universal markdown reader for viewing messes.
  - `scripts/build_weblog.js`: an automated generator for `weblog/index.html`.
  - `darketype/entries/`: populated with "origin story" and "rebellion" content.
- **the leak**: specific UI elements (like the contribution graph header) now "leak" into the darketype mode.
