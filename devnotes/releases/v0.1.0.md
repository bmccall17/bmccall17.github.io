# v0.1.0 - phase zero complete

**released:** feb 06, 2026

## summary
phase 0 is complete. we have established the "darketype" manifesto, the nerd-core design system, and the "chaos protocols" (rules, workflows, mess schema). the "failed to list dir" error above was a perfect chaotic christening for this release.

---

## changes
- **manifesto**: created the one-page thesis at `darketype/index.html`.
- **design**: implemented "nerd-core" monochrome css with glitch animations.
- **workflows**: migrated `/orchestrator` and `/ship` from sibling projects; created `/selfhealing`.
- **rules**: codified the "html-first" and "chaos/lowercase" philosophies.
- **security**: added protocols for secrets and manual deploys.
